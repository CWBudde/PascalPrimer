PascalPrimer
============

PascalPrimer is a programming environment application designed for fast learning of the Pascal programming language. It allows you to write code and immediately see the result and impact of any changes interactively.

PascalPrimer uses the Pascal dialect DWScript as programming language with a thin interface for text and graphical output (turtle graphic). 


About DWScript
--------------

DWScript is an object-oriented scripting engine based on the Delphi language (Object Pascal), with extensions borrowed from other Pascal dialects. It introduces a few Pascal language extensions of its own as well. Most of these come handy as they reduce the amount of typing.
